# Today's Work Report 

## 1. Review of Operational Dataset in the Field of Formation Drilling
- **Objective:** Find an operational dataset related to formation drilling.
- **Result:** Unsuccessful attempt due to data unavailability.

## 2. Review of Articles on Formation Drilling and Drilling Damage
- **Objective:** Familiarize with various aspects of formation drilling and the damages occurring during drilling.
- **Action:** Conducted a brief review of several related articles.

## 3. Development of New Code for Generating a Synthetic Dataset
- **Background:** Utilizing previous codes shared in the WhatsApp group.
- **Features of the New Dataset:**
  - Contains 10 million records
  - Includes 25 features (with additional new features)
  - Uses equations and mathematical relationships among the features
  - Completes class balance in the generated dataset
- **Action:** The download link for the new dataset (hosted on Google Drive) was inserted in the `dataset_use.md` file.

## 4. Examination of Frida Installation and Usage
- **Action:** Attempted to install and use Frida for simulating rock-fluid interactions.
- **Issue:** The Frida website did not load; search results primarily referenced installing the `frida-tools` library.
- **Result:** It may be necessary to consider an alternative tool for simulating rock-fluid interactions.

# FDDDC Project Progress Report

## Completed Activities

### 1. SRS Document Study and Understanding
- Comprehensive review of system requirements
- Identification of key project components

### 2. Dataset Development
#### Basic Dataset (1M Records)
- Implementation of base data generation code
- Observation of limitations in field relationships

#### Advanced Dataset (10M Records)
- Correction of errors in original code
- Development of non-linear feature relationships
- Merging of 10 data segments:

### 3. Preliminary Analysis

- Initial statistical analysis
- Identification of class imbalance (1/1000 ratio)
- Initial noise assessment

### Future Plan

| **Priority** | **Action**               | **Description**                    |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1            | Data quality improvement | Noise removal and validation       |
| 2            | Data balancing           | Augmentation methods               |
| 3            | Framework development    | Monitoring system design           |

### Key Points

- Data is structurally relatively clean
- Urgent need for class balancing
- More detailed feature validation is essential
